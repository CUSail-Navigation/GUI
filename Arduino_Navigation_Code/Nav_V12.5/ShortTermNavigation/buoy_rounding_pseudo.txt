Buoy rounding pseudo code so

assuming latitude longitude coordinates have been converted to a flat plane in meter coordinates

assume boat position b(bx,by)
wp0 w position w0x, w0x and rotation r0 (ccw or cw)
wp1 w position w1x, w1x and rotation r1 (ccw or cw)
buoys have a rounding distance r that accounts for the turning radius of the boat, granularity of GPS, etc.
wind has an angle wrt North wind_angle


vector b_wp0 is the vector from b to wp0
vector b_wp1 is the vector from wp0 to wp1
find the angle a from b_wp0 to b_wp1 in the direction of r0 (the angle around wp0)

find the line l_w1 from the boat to wp1
find the perpindicular distance pd from l_w1 to wp0

if a>180 || (a<180 && pd<r):
  find the point p1_wp0 on the wp0 circle that is the intersection of b and wp0
  diff_x=w1x-p1_wp0.x
  diff_y=w1y-p1_wp0.y

  rotated_x=diff_y
  rotated_y=diff_x

  according to r0, negated either rotated_x or rotated_y s.t. it is a new point rotated in direction r0
    negate x is cw
    negate y is ccw

  intended_point=w1x+rotated_x, w1y+rotated_y
  vector boat_intended is the vector from the boat to intended_point

  set angle_waypoint to be the angle from wind_angle to boat_intended

else:
  increment waypoint counter and recalculate angle_waypoint with wp1 as the next waypoint and wp2 as the second next waypoint
